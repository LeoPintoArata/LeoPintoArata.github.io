    "text": "Hola! I’m Leonardo (or Leo, if you prefer), a researcher in cognitive psychology. My research focuses on how humans learn linguistic regularities during reading, and how both humans and non-human primates learn non-linguistic regularities. I am particularly interested in the predictive processes and general mechanisms that underlie statistical and associative learning.\nIn January 2026, I will start a postdoctoral position at the Université Libre de Bruxelles, working alongside Arnaud Destrebecqz. My project will combine behavioural experiments and computational modelling in order to better characterise the mechanisms underlying statistical learning. Specifically, I will be testing whether learning is best captured by chunk-based or transition-based models.\nPreviously, I completed my PhD at the Centre de Recherche en Psychologie et Neurosciences (Aix-Marseille Université, France), under the supervision of Arnaud Rey and Carlos Ramisch. My doctoral research investigated the acquisition of multiword sequences in real time. Part of this research examined sequence learning in Guinea baboons, revealing the similarities in learning mechanisms between humans and non-human primates."
